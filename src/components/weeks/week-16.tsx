                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week is our project showcase week. We set up a panel and TAs will walk around grading and providing feedback. We got a lot of feedbacks from this and even some complements. This project taught us a lot, especially that poor planning can come back and bite us. However it's also been fun developing this project.
