We also learnt about <span className="font-bold">action plan</span>. We're then assigned to come up with an action plan about affiliate marketing, make a presentation about it, then come present it to the whole class.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do something you need to do it with a well-done plan! In week 2 we get to study about how we should set goals, how we should make a plan for our project, even how to make decisions. This class helps us understand why it is important to work together as a group and <span className="font-bold">make a plan when you are working</span>.  By having a good plan and separating the tasks well, your workflow will go smoothly, and it&apos;ll help you work without being too torn-up.
